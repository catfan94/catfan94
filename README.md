- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @catfan94
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in gaming, coding, drawing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning small projects on different programming languages.
 I'm always looking for some easy projects to start on while at the same time completing my
online courses at SNHU. It's exciting to see all the potential projects I can work on.
But I know I have to start small to be able to master coding.
